# Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by infected female *Anopheles* mosquitoes. This analysis explores malaria cases from 2000 to 2017 globally and by regions (Americas, Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, Western Pacific), focusing on trends in case numbers and death rates.

# Research Question, Aims, and Methodology

## Research Question

**How has global malaria cases and reported death cases changed over time and across different regions from 2000 to 2017?**

## Aims

-   To visualize trends in malaria cases and deaths globally from 2000 onwards.
-   To analyze regional differences and identify patterns or anomalies over time.
-   To better understand where malaria remains a major public health challenge.

## Methodology

-   **Dataset:** WHO malaria data (reported cases and deaths by country and year).
-   **Visualization Methods:**
    -   Scatter plots to show temporal trends.
    -   Dynamic choropleth maps to demonstrate spatial changes.

# Dataset Overview

-   **Total Rows:** 1,944
-   **Total Columns:** 5
    -   `Country` (Categorical): 190 unique country names.
    -   `Year` (Numerical): Reporting year (2000–2017).
    -   `No. of cases` (Numerical): Reported malaria cases (0 to 15.1 million).
    -   `No. of deaths` (Numerical): Reported malaria deaths (0 to 39,054).
    -   `WHO Region` (Categorical): 6 regions (Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South-East Asia, Western Pacific).

# Future Work and Questions

-   Explore causes behind regional differences (e.g., healthcare access, climate, interventions).
-   Update the dataset with more recent years.
-   Investigate specific country case studies for deeper insights.
-   Analyze the relationship between malaria interventions and case/death trends.

# Conclusion

Teamwork and visual analytics have enabled a clearer understanding of malaria's global impact. Future studies should continue to leverage updated data and innovative visualization techniques to deepen insights and support global health initiatives.
