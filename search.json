Transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, malaria is both a biological and social challenge that intersects with issues of poverty, geography, and political will. This report presents an in-depth data-driven exploration of malaria cases and deaths from 2000 to 2017. It aims to uncover global and regional patterns, analyze changes over time, and offer insights into how the fight against malaria has progressed in different parts of the world.\nThe central question guiding this study is: How have global malaria cases and death rates evolved over time, and how do these trends vary across WHO regions and countries between 2000 and 2017? To investigate this, we used a dataset provided by the World Health Organization that includes annual country-level records of reported malaria cases and deaths, categorized by WHO region. We employed both static and animated visualizations to reveal temporal and spatial patterns in the data. This approach enables us to not only assess long-term global trends but also to highlight persistent regional disparities and emerging areas of concern.",

But starting around 2008, there is a dramatic shift. As shown in this plot, reported cases begin to rise sharply, reaching over 125 million by 2017. This pattern appears to contradict the common belief that malaria is steadily declining worldwide.\nHowever, the increase may reflect expanded diagnostic capacity and improved surveillance, rather than an actual surge in transmission. Many countries introduced more comprehensive reporting systems in the 2010s, which likely resulted in a higher number of cases being documented. In other words, we might be seeing more malaria not because the situation is worsening, but because we’re getting better at counting it.",

Despite the sharp increase in reported cases, the distribution of deaths remains relatively wide but doesn’t follow the same sharp upward trajectory. Most countries consistently report relatively low death numbers, while a small number continue to report high fatalities each year—sometimes over 50,000.\nThis suggests that while malaria remains widespread, it is becoming less deadly overall, possibly due to wider access to treatment and earlier diagnosis. However, the range between countries is still large. Some countries have clearly succeeded in reducing malaria mortality, while others continue to struggle.",

The pattern here is unmistakable: Africa accounts for the vast majority of global malaria deaths, and this has remained true throughout the entire 2000–2017 period.\nIn contrast, other regions such as Europe and the Americas report very low death counts, often close to zero. Even South-East Asia, once a major malaria hotspot, shows a steady decline in mortality across the 18 years. These trends reveal a stark inequality in the global burden of malaria. While some regions are approaching elimination, others—especially in sub-Saharan Africa—continue to face high and persistent mortality.",

But what does the malaria burden look like at the country level? Using interactive Plotly maps, we can track changes over time and visualize not just where malaria is spreading, but where it’s killing.\nThe first map focuses on reported malaria cases from 2000 to 2017. Here, countries like India, Brazil, and Indonesia appear prominently, with India consistently reporting over 2 million cases per year. Interestingly, many African countries show little or no shading in early years—not because malaria wasn’t present, but because surveillance systems were still developing. Over time, these countries become more visible, reinforcing the idea that part of the global increase in reported cases may be due to improved detection rather than worsening transmission.\nThe second map shows malaria-related deaths, and the picture shifts dramatically. South Asian and South American countries that previously looked severe now appear much lighter. Meanwhile, central and western African countries dominate the death map, with the darkest shades consistently appearing in places like Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This highlights a critical distinction: many regions have high numbers of infections, but only some face the compounded burden of both high infection and high mortality, often due to weaker healthcare systems. The final map puts everything together. Background shading represents case counts, while red circles denote the number of deaths. Countries like India are dark blue but have small red circles—indicating effective treatment and relatively low fatality rates. In contrast, the large red circles clustered across central Africa tell a different story: many of these countries are not only struggling with high malaria transmission, but also lack the infrastructure to prevent deaths.\nThese maps don’t just tell us where malaria is. They show us where it is deadliest. And that’s where the world’s attention and resources need to stay focused.",

While surveillance and treatment have improved in many countries, millions of people remain at risk, and tens of thousands still die every year from a preventable and treatable illness.\nAs we move forward, the goal is not just to reduce numbers on a chart, but to close the global gap in prevention and care. That means targeted investment in the regions that need it most, continued innovation in diagnostics and treatment, and stronger international cooperation. Data like this helps us understand where the problems are. What happens next depends on whether we act on it.",

Remember that the most effective team leaders build their relationships of trust and loyalty, rather than fear or the power of their positions.\n\nConsider each employee’s ideas as valuable. Remember that there is no such thing as a stupid idea.\nBe aware of employees’ unspoken feelings. Set an example to team members by being open with employees and sensitive to their moods and feelings.\nAct as a harmonizing influence. Look for chances to mediate and resolve minor disputes; point continually toward the team’s higher goals.\nBe clear when communicating. Be careful to clarify directives.\nEncourage trust and cooperation among employees on your team. Remember that the relationships team members establish among themselves are every bit as important as those you establish with them. As the team begins to take shape, pay close attention to the ways in which team members work together and take steps to improve communication, cooperation, trust, and respect in those relationships.\nEncourage team members to share information. Emphasize the importance of each team member’s contribution and demonstrate how all of their jobs operate together to move the entire team closer to its goal. Delegate problem-solving tasks to the team. Let the team work on creative solutions together.\nFacilitate communication. Remember that communication is the single most important factor in successful teamwork. Facilitating communication does not mean holding meetings all the time. Instead it means setting an example by remaining open to suggestions and concerns, by asking questions and offering help, and by doing everything you can to avoid confusion in your own communication.\nEstablish team values and goals; evaluate team performance. Be sure to talk with members about the progress they are making toward established goals so that employees get a sense both of their success and of the challenges that lie ahead. Address teamwork in performance standards.\nMake sure that you have a clear idea of what you need to accomplish.\nUse consensus. Set objectives, solve problems, and plan for action. While it takes much longer to establish consensus, this method ultimately provides better decisions and greater productivity because it secures every employee’s commitment to all phases of the work.\nSet ground rules for the team. These are the norms that you and the team establish to ensure efficiency and success. They can be simple directives (Team members are to be punctual for meetings) or general guidelines (Every team member has the right to offer ideas and suggestions), but you should make sure that the team creates these ground rules by consensus and commits to them, both as a group and as individuals.",

Each country is colored on a gradient from light to dark red, where darker shades indicate a higher number of deaths. As the animation progresses through time, we can observe how the burden of malaria shifts across regions. Notably, countries in sub-Saharan Africa—especially the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria—consistently show the darkest shades, highlighting their persistent struggle with malaria mortality. This temporal and spatial visualization helps emphasize where intervention efforts have been or still need to be concentrated.\n\nmalaria_clean &lt;- reported %&gt;%\n  select(Country, Year, `No..of.cases`, `No..of.deaths`) %&gt;%\n  rename(\n    country = Country,\n    year = Year,\n    cases = `No..of.cases`,\n    deaths = `No..of.deaths`\n  )\n\n\nfig &lt;- plot_ly() %&gt;%\n  add_trace(\n    data = malaria_clean,\n    type = \"choropleth\",\n    locations = ~country,\n    locationmode = \"country names\",\n    z = ~cases,\n    frame = ~year,\n    colorscale = \"Blues\",\n    reversescale = TRUE,\n    text = ~paste(\"Country:\", country,\n                  \"&lt;br&gt;Total Cases:\", format(cases, big.mark = \",\"),\n                  \"&lt;br&gt;Deaths:\", format(deaths, big.mark = \",\")),\n    hoverinfo = \"text\",\n    colorbar = list(title = \"Total Cases\"),\n    marker = list(line = list(color = \"white\", width = 0.5))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n\n  add_trace(\n    data = malaria_clean,\n    type = \"scattergeo\",\n    locations = ~country,\n    locationmode = \"country names\",\n    frame = ~year,\n    marker = list(\n      size = ~sqrt(deaths) * 0.25,\n      color = 'red',\n      opacity = 0.6,\n      line = list(width = 0)\n    ),\n    hoverinfo = \"none\",\n    showlegend = FALSE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  \n  layout(\n    title = \"Global Malaria Cases and Deaths from 2000 to 2017\",\n    geo = list(\n      showframe = FALSE,\n      showcountries = TRUE,\n      showcoastlines = FALSE,\n      countrycolor = \"grey\",\n      landcolor = \"lightgrey\",\n      projection = list(type = \"equirectangular\"),\n      bgcolor = \"white\"\n    )\n  )\n\nfig\n\nWarning: Ignoring 234 observations\n\n\nNo scattergeo mode specifed:\n  Setting the mode to markers\n  Read more about this attribute -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Explanation\nThis interactive map illustrates global malaria cases and deaths from the year 2000 to 2017. The background color of each country represents the total number of malaria cases, using a blue gradient—darker blue indicates higher case counts. Overlaying the map, we use red circles to represent the number of reported deaths. The larger the circle, the higher the death toll.\nThis dual-encoded map lets us compare both the prevalence of malaria and its mortality burden at once. For instance, you can see that many central and western African countries not only have dark blue shading—indicating high case numbers—but also large red circles, revealing significant death counts. Meanwhile, other regions may have lighter shades with smaller circles, showing lower disease burden.\nOverall, this visualization helps us track the geographic and temporal patterns of malaria, highlighting where the disease hits hardest and where public health efforts should be prioritized.",

    "text": "Your case study will go here.\n\nGermany’s Multiparty System Unlike the U.S. two-party system, Germany’s Bundestag includes multiple significant parties. The chart shows that no party typically wins a majority, which necessitates coalition governments. CDU/CSU (center-right) and SPD (center-left) are the largest parties but have seen declining shares over time, making smaller parties like the Greens, FDP, and AfD increasingly relevant in coalition-building.\nParty Ideology Distribution The ideological spectrum chart maps German parties from left to right. The Left (far-left) and AfD (far-right) anchor the extremes. SPD, Greens, and CDU/CSU are more centrist, though CDU leans conservative. The chart reveals that German political ideology is more left-leaning overall than U.S. counterparts — even the CDU is not as far right as American Republicans.\nVoter Base by Region (East vs. West) A geographic map shows stark regional divides: The Left dominates in the former East Germany. CDU and SPD perform better in the wealthier West. AfD shows stronger support in economically disadvantaged eastern regions, reflecting discontent. This highlights how historical and economic divisions continue to shape voter alignment decades after reunification.\nEconomic Status and Party Affiliation A scatterplot links income and education levels to party support. AfD draws support from lower-income, less-educated voters — similar to Trump’s base. Greens and FDP attract wealthier, more educated demographics. CDU and SPD are more broadly distributed but still reflect socioeconomic divides.\nAfD’s Rise and Fall A line graph tracks AfD’s polling trajectory: The party rose sharply during the refugee crisis in 2015. It peaked around 15% in late 2016, then declined to about 10% by mid-2017. This trend aligns with reduced immigration levels and possible public reaction to global right-wing populism.",
