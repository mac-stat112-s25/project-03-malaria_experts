Your case study will go here.

1.  Germany’s Multiparty System Unlike the U.S. two-party system, Germany's Bundestag includes multiple significant parties.
    The chart shows that no party typically wins a majority, which necessitates coalition governments.
    CDU/CSU (center-right) and SPD (center-left) are the largest parties but have seen declining shares over time, making smaller parties like the Greens, FDP, and AfD increasingly relevant in coalition-building.

2.  Party Ideology Distribution The ideological spectrum chart maps German parties from left to right.
    The Left (far-left) and AfD (far-right) anchor the extremes.
    SPD, Greens, and CDU/CSU are more centrist, though CDU leans conservative.
    The chart reveals that German political ideology is more left-leaning overall than U.S. counterparts — even the CDU is not as far right as American Republicans.

3.  Voter Base by Region (East vs. West) A geographic map shows stark regional divides: The Left dominates in the former East Germany.
    CDU and SPD perform better in the wealthier West.
    AfD shows stronger support in economically disadvantaged eastern regions, reflecting discontent.
    This highlights how historical and economic divisions continue to shape voter alignment decades after reunification.

4.  Economic Status and Party Affiliation A scatterplot links income and education levels to party support.
    AfD draws support from lower-income, less-educated voters — similar to Trump’s base.
    Greens and FDP attract wealthier, more educated demographics.
    CDU and SPD are more broadly distributed but still reflect socioeconomic divides.

5.  AfD’s Rise and Fall A line graph tracks AfD’s polling trajectory: The party rose sharply during the refugee crisis in 2015.
    It peaked around 15% in late 2016, then declined to about 10% by mid-2017.
    This trend aligns with reduced immigration levels and possible public reaction to global right-wing populism.
