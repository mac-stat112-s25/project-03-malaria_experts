## Effective Teamwork

Teamwork is a foundational component of successful organizations, yet it requires more than just collaboration—it calls for a strong set of interpersonal and problem-solving skills. According to SkillPath’s article *“Effective Teamwork: 8 Simple Characteristics of a Great Team”* (2023), high-functioning teams share several defining traits:

1. Dependence 
  Team members recognize their mutual reliance, focusing on shared and individual goals without undermining others for personal gain.

2. Trust 
  Open, trusting environments allow members to express concerns, ask questions, and offer creative solutions without fear.

3. Ownership 
  Members take personal responsibility and feel invested in the team’s outcomes, striving for collective rather than individual success.

4. Individual Strengths 
  Effective teams leverage the unique knowledge and skills of each member, contributing meaningfully to shared objectives.

5. Open Communication 
  Continuous, clear communication ensures mutual understanding and reinforces a culture of transparency.

6. Ongoing Growth 
  Strong teams support professional development, encouraging members to learn, experiment, and grow—even through mistakes.

7. Group Decision-Making 
  Decisions are made collaboratively, valuing each person’s perspective while accepting that the leader may decide when consensus cannot be reached.

8. Strong Conflict Resolution
  Healthy teams resolve disagreements promptly and constructively, maintaining open lines of communication throughout.
